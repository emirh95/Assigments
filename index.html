<h1> The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World </h1>
<p> The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable 
    creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among 
    Hellenic sightseers and only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in 
    Mesopotamia. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented 
    perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently,
    plus the sun and moon. Many similar lists have been made. </p>
